This repository is a collection of quantum machine learning models implemented using various quantum computing frameworks. 
By the time being, the models were implemented on Tencents's `TensorCircuit` and IBM's `Qiskit`.

## Model 1: Quantum Variational Circuit (Farhi & Neven)
- Description: Implements a quantum variational circuit for MNIST Digits classification, as per Farhi & Neven (2018).
- Directory: `/mnist`

## Model 2: Quantum Support Vector Machine with $ZZ$-feature map
- Description: Implements a quantum version of a support vector machine for classification tasks.
- Directory: `/qsvm`
